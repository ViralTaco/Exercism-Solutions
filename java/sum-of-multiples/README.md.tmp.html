<h1>Sum Of Multiples</h1>

<p>Given a number, find the sum of all the unique multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.</p>

<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.</p>

<p>The sum of these multiples is 78.</p>

<h1>Running the tests</h1>

<p>You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal:</p>

<p><code>sh
$ gradle test
</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>gradlew.bat</code> if you're on Windows</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.</p>

<p>Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
<code>@Ignore("Remove to run test")</code> annotation.</p>

<h2>Submitting Incomplete Solutions</h2>

<p>It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.</p>
